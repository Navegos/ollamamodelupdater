# Ollama Model Updater

Archiving: It's been ages since I updated this and there are better tools for this, like Gollama.

The Ollama Model Updater will look at all the models you have on your system, check if there is a different version on ollama.ai, and pull the model if there is. Super simple.

You can grab the executable for your platform over on the [releases page](https://github.com/technovangelist/ollamamodelupdater/releases)
